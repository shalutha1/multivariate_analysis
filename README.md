# Heart Disease Risk Prediction: A Comprehensive Multivariate Analysis

🚨 **Heart Disease Risk Prediction: A Comprehensive Multivariate Analysis** 🚨

I am excited to share my mini project on heart disease risk prediction, where I applied advanced statistical techniques to analyze a dataset with 21 clinical and lifestyle variables! 🧠💖

## Project Overview:
- **Dataset:** 7067 observations with variables like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, exercise habits, and more.
- **Techniques Used:** 
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce data complexity and highlight key risk factors 📊
  - **Factor Analysis (FA)** to uncover hidden patterns and group correlated risk factors 🔍
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** to classify individuals based on heart disease status 🏥

## Key Findings:
- PCA identified the most influential factors contributing to heart disease risk like cholesterol levels, BMI, and triglycerides 🌟
- Factor analysis revealed 4 main latent factors driving the risk 🧬
- LDA achieved an accuracy of 79.01% in classifying 'No Heart Disease' cases, but needs improvement for predicting heart disease cases (focusing on minority class) 💡

## Next Steps:
- Model improvement (SMOTE technique) to handle class imbalance.
- Add more features like genetic data for better prediction power 🧬



Proud to apply multivariate techniques and help improve heart disease risk prediction! 🚀 Let’s use data to drive better healthcare decisions! 🌍
